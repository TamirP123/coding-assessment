# Project Information
In this challenge I created a Coding Assessment. When the start button is clicked,a timer starts,
the assessment questions pop up on screen, and iterate when an option is picked. Game ends once 
all questions are answered, or timer hits zero. User can enter initals and display their score 
on the high score list.
